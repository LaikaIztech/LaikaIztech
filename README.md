## What are we?

Project: Laika is a proposal to place a number of probes to certain locations within IZTECH to gather data on the dog
population of the school.

## Why are we?

Project Laika will attempt to detect agressive dog populations and their distribution around the school. To this purpose,
Laika employs small devices with WiFi connections and small solar panels. Each Laika "Beacon" is also equipped with a 
microphone. Beacons inform the system when a bark is detected, with the amount of barks used to determine dog agresiveness
in an area, which correlates to the number of dogs in the area.

## How Are We?

Laika Beacons are small devices that transmit their audio to a central server, then the audio is scanned for barks close-to-real-time.
