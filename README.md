## What are we?

Project: Laika is a proposal to place a number of probes to certain locations within IZTECH to gather data on the dog
population of the school.

IZTECH does not have a dog problem, but it is the belief of our team that we have a dog overpopulation problem that
is getting worse with each passing day, which is creating a strain
on the wellbeing of the animals and the students alike.

In order to help alleviate this problem, Project: Laika aims to gather data necessary to develop strategies combat
dog overpopulation.

We do not wish euthnasation or mass-euthnasation of animals, and we strongly believe for any creature this should be
a matter of last resort. We believe numeraous technological and logistical methods can help combat this problem both in short term
and much more long term, we will propose a paper detailing our  recomendations after we gather the necessary data, make the
necessary research and contact the necessary experts.

## Why are we?

Project Laika will attempt to detect agressive dog populations and their distribution around the school. To this purpose,
Laika employs small devices with WiFi connections and small solar panels. Each Laika "Beacon" is also equipped with a 
microphone. Beacons inform the system when a bark is detected, with the amount of barks used to determine dog agresiveness
in an area, which correlates to the number of dogs in the area.

## How Are We?

Laika Beacons are small devices that transmit their audio to a central server, then the audio is scanned for barks close-to-real-time.
